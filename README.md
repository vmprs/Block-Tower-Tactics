# Block Tower Tactics

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and the Pillow library for handling images. The game features colorful Tetromino shapes and user controls for moving and rotating the pieces as they fall toward the bottom of the board.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics
- Colorful Tetromino shapes
- Scoring system
- Background image
- Responsive controls using keyboard input

## Changing The Background

Changing the background is as easy as pie, open the code in an editor (Notepad++ or just classic Notepad)
Place your background in the bg folder and call it whatever
and then, when you in the code, you will see bg\bg0.jpg - change bg0.jpg to yourimagename.jpg
Kaboom, you changed the background.

## Running the Game

1. After ensuring all dependencies are installed and the font is added to your system, download or clone this repository.

- **R Key**: Rotate the Tetromino counterclockwise.
- **Restart Button**: Click this button to restart the game after it ends.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to manipulate falling Tetromino shapes by moving them sideways and rotating them. The goal is to form complete rows on the game board. When a row is filled, it clears out, and points are awarded. The game continues until the player can no longer place new Tetrominoes on the board.

Enjoy playing Tetris!
